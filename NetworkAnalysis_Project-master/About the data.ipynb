    "To create the network from the data we take \"Airpot Id\" as nodes. As it is indetification number assigned by US DOT, it is unik, and would allow to analise accros year, if needed. The number of connected nodes: 1236.\\\n",

    "Data gives \"Origin Airport ID\" and \"Destination Airport ID\", so the network should be DIRECTED grath. The data also have information about different airlines between same airport and loops - flights with same starting and ending nodes, it also can be analized as multigraph. So the amount of edges would depend on the grath.\n",
